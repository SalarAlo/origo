# What this is

Origo is a Linux only 3D game engine written in C++23 and modern OpenGL.

It is intentionally conservative.
- no Vulkan
- no attempt to be a beginner friendly engine

The goal is not accessibility.

## Design Choices and Goals

Origo is not an engine that is trying to compete with godot or unity. 
This engine is more of a learning experience for me and i will be submitting 
this project for the CV-Tag 2026 at the University of Koblenz.

If you are looking for rapid prototyping, visual scripting, or cross platform
deployment, this engine is not for you.
