control flow of creating an asset:
	1. [X] Right Click on the Asset Panel
	2. [ ] Choose what type of asset you want to create (texture, shader, ...)
	3. [ ] Set its values and attributes to your liking
	4. [ ] (For Now) you can only refer to the asset via its 
		-> (this shall be changed to use a selection menu and/or drag and drop)
	
details to keep in mind when implementing:
	------------------------------------- GENERAL ---------------------------------------

	1. Each Asset shall have a (json) file associated to it containing all of its data
		-> Changing the attributes of an asset changes these values in the json file as well
	2. There needs to be a clear and distinct seperation between the runtime asset objects
	   that contain the logic (eg. m_Shader->UseProgram()) and the actual to be saved static
	   POD objects that literually only contain the data so that on restart the assets persist
	3. Each static POD Asset uses an UUID. The runtime Asset Objects have a RID. when assets
	   refer to each other (eg. a Material refers to a shader), than the runtime objects use
	   the RID while the POD Objects use that UUID created once
	
	------------------------------------- Generated vs. Imported ------------------------

	1. Generated Assets are assets which are  actually manually created by the user of the engine
	2. Imported Assets are automatically created as soon as a sourceable file is detected (.png, .jpg, ...)
	3. 

	------------------------------------- Importing -------------------------------------

	1. a lot of Assets are imported and not created directly in the engine.
	2. They have what we call a **Source File**
